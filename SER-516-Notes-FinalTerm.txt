Clean Design I, II

Three Design Pattern and their class Diagram
	- Observer (Mouse Listeners)
	- Delegator (Professor TA Example)
	- Factory (Product Client)

when we want to share data between two modules good to use Observer Pattern

Kent Beck's Key Idea for Design Principle
	- Dependency Injection 
		- Nothing but using or Association
	- Seperation of Concern
		- Pattern
	-	Low Coupling 
		- Lowest amount of lines connecting things
		- Association better than composition
	- Readability

Too much Coupling will result in too much communication b/w team member that is bad.

Problems discussed for class diagrams 
	- Check if diamond or arrows are placed in correct direction,
	- Check if there are arrows or diamonds or just a line,
	- Loops are bad,
	- Sometimes think in terms of Model View Controller and what each class is.
	- Check if diamond is really required.
	- Association is better than composition


Structure Metrics I,II,III


Kent Beck's Rules for design
- Write Test
- Eliminate Duplication
- Ensure Expressiveness
- Minimize number of items


Three Metrics 
	- Acyclic Dependency Principle
		- More the loop bad the design
		- Loop is fine if it has a justification
	- Stable Abstract Principle 
		- More stable more abstract it should be 
		- Stablility means hard to change
		- Instability of 1 is best
	- Stable Dependency Principle
		- X->Y Y instability should be less
		- X->Y Y abstraction should be more
		- D = A + I - 1 Calculate - |D|
