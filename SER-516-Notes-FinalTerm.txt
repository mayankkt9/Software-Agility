Clean Design

Three Design Pattern and their class Diagram
	- Observer (Mouse Listeners)
	- Delegator (Professor TA Example)
	- Factory (Product Client)

when we want to share data between two modules good to use Observer Pattern

Three Key Idea for Design Principle
	- Dependency Injection 
		- Nothing but using or Association
	- Seperation of Concern
		- Pattern
	-	Low Coupling 
		- Lowest amount of lines connecting things
		- Association better than composition

Too much Coupling will result in too much communication b/w team member that is bad.

Problems discussed for class diagrams 
	- Check if diamond or arrows are placed in correct direction,
	- Check if there are arrows or diamonds or just a line,
	- Loops are bad,
	- Sometimes think in terms of Model View Controller and what each class is.
	- Check if diamond is really required.
