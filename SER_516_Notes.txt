The product owner is usually a key individual who may in many instances control the funding for the project to be developed, or if he or she doesnâ€™t control funding, is responsible to those who do for delivering their visions in a way their return on investment is maximized.
a product owner is the leader responsible for maximizing the value of the products created by a scrum development team.
